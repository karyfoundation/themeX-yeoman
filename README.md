# themeX yeoman generator
This module provides a project generator for [themeX](https://github.com/karyfoundation/themeX) so that you can easily build a project.

## Whats included?
- It generates a base file with generated UUIDS and all the necessary structure (so you don't have to worry about the rest)

You don't have to!! it installs automatically with the main themeX package as a dependency. If you have themeX, you can just go run
```
% yo themex
```
And you have it! It's all it takes to generate you're badass awesome themeX file!
